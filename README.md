# OpenVK Legacy for Android
_Author: [Dmitry Tretyakov (Tinelix)](https://github.com/tretdm)_

**OpenVK Legacy** is mobile client for retro devices running Android 2.1 Eclair and higher. Code provided here is not stable yet.

We will be happy to accept your bugreports [in our bug-tracker](https://github.com/openvk/mobile-android-legacy/projects/1).

## Building
We recommend using [Android Studio 2.3.2](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive) along with JRE 7 and Gradle 2.0.0 as it is more convenient to build the APK file there.
