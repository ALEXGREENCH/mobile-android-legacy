1. Fixed infinite scroll.
2. Now thumbnails for vids are fully working, they are shown even during video loading. Yes, it's still a GIF, but it's what it is.
3. Added highlighting of slidein menu items.
4. Added the ability to force caching when necessary, if not all photos have loaded adequately.
5. Friend requests in the tablet interface are now displayed in a grid. The remaining lists will be migrating from ListView to RecyclerView soon, so the grid should now appear in the lists of friends, correspondence, groups, and members.
6. Fixes for other known bugs and crashes.
