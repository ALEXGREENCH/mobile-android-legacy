In this version of the client, the main focus is on simplifying the code of both the AppActivity itself and switching between fragments, already in a separate FragmentNavigation class, and a full implementation of the top menu for Android 2.x.

Other changes:
1. In the action bar (top action bar), the choice between the subscription feed and the global feed is now on top of the spinner.
2. Fixed display of information in the "About instance" window.
