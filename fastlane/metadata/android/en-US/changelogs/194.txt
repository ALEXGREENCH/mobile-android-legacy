1. Bugs fixed:
   + fixed the list of participants in the group
   + slightly reworked text reduction and conversion of links to HTML
   + fixed crash after an unsuccessful execution of the Account.getCounters method
   + fixed photo caching again
   + minor bugs fixed
2. Partially earned video previews.
3. Instead of 50 first posts, only 25 are displayed, and this should also reduce the load on the UI thread.

Known issues:
1. Some previews may show color "blotches" artifacts, probably due to some difference in color space.
2. Infinite scroll works very strangely.
