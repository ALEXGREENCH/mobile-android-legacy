1. The action bar has been redesigned. Two libraries are now used as a basis: Retro-ActionBar and Retro-PopupMenu.
2. Fixed a crash when trying to open an application on a tablet.
3. Fixed scrolling feed.
4. Improved settings design.

⚠️ Due to the fact that the test signatures do not match, a direct update is not possible. Please remove the old build before installation.
