1. Slightly rewritten the AboutProfileLayout class, which is responsible for information about a profile or group. And yes, there is no empty area left!
2. The transparent statusbar has been returned, which was before the rewriting of all application sources, but now the implementation is somewhat different from the old code base.
3. Fix with the choice of app.
4. Fit content window fix for Android 11+
