1. The tablet mode of the interface has been fixed again (the problem was that they forgot to update the layout)
2. As in VK 3.x, you can also fit the video in width and return the optimal resolution back.
3. The logic for processing JSON requests has been redone, now in a separate thread, thanks to which the application has become a little less freezing, but this does not fix the ANR state completely, since the RecyclerView component for lists was involved in the hang.
4. Account avatar hotfix.
