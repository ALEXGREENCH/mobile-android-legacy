1. A long-awaited innovation - reposts. As in the web version, you can only send a repost to your personal wall.
2. The behavior of incorrect display of URLs has been fixed again, but in other places.
3. The list of subscribed groups displays the number of participants in the signatures.
4. The round progressbar was replaced by another component from the support library - Android-PullToRefresh (https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh) in a modified form to comply with the general style of the application. By the way, the bug when trying to scroll up has already been fixed.
