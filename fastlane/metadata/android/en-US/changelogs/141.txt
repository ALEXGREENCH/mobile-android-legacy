1. Improved the work of the meeting. You can now set or disable notification sound. In addition, you can enable or use a LED indicator and vibration.
2. Added avatars in incoming messages.
3. Fixed a bug allowed in the layout for landscape mode.
4. Improved Ukrainian localization. Thanks for that @AlesAlte (https://github.com/AlesAlte). There were some errors in the syntax, so they were later fixed.
5. As it was in the original VK 3.x, the blue "Отправить" button now uses the "Отпр." injury (only Russian & Ukrainian localization).
6. Small fixes in the list of comments.
