1. Improved the readability of the source code by dividing long lines, largely creeping out beyond the vertical bar. This allows viewing without the need for horizontal scrolling.
2. There were ticks in the posts, the news feed was fixed. A similar fix is waiting for OpenVK Refresh, you just have to wait until it comes out.
3. The app no longer crashes after a successful attempt to post a comment.
4. Fixed minor bugs.
