1. Updated viewer interface with transparent action bar. It can be hidden or brought back with a single click.
2. Now you can view photos in the viewer in original quality (without loss artifacts), as well as save them.
3. Added infinity scrolling in the "Friends" and "Groups" sections.
4. Fixed crashes in Android 2.x related to the opening of the "About instance" item.
5. Of course, it was not without another fix of likes and polls counters, so try it.
